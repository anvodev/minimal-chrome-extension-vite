# Minimal Chrome Extension with Vite

This is a basic template for creating a Chrome extension using Vite for the build process.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository (if applicable).
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Development

To run the extension in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server.

## Build

To build the extension for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` directory containing the optimized extension files.

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner.
3.  Click the "Load unpacked" button.
4.  Select the `dist` directory generated by the build process.
